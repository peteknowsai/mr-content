# Safety — Southeast Florida

Write safety and navigation cards for SE Florida captains.

## Inlet Navigation

### Hillsboro Inlet
- **Approach**: Follow marked channel carefully, shoaling on north side
- **Tide timing**: Best on incoming tide, avoid outgoing tide with northeast wind
- **Wave action**: Can build dangerous standing waves with wind against tide
- **Commercial traffic**: Watch for charter boats and commercial vessels
- **Emergency**: Lighthouse Point Marina inside inlet for emergency shelter

### Jupiter Inlet  
- **Approach**: Well-marked channel, but watch for shoaling
- **Tide timing**: Dangerous with northeast wind against strong outgoing tide
- **Rock jetties**: Stay in marked channel, rocks extend underwater
- **Current**: Strong tidal flow, plan for set and drift
- **Emergency**: Multiple marinas inside for emergency shelter

### Port Everglades
- **Commercial traffic**: Major cruise and cargo port — STAY CLEAR of commercial vessels
- **Ship channels**: Marked shipping lanes have right of way
- **VHF monitoring**: Monitor VHF 16 and port operations channels
- **Approach**: Deep water approach, well marked
- **Security zones**: Stay clear of cruise terminals and military areas

## Gulf Stream Safety

### Current & Weather Interaction
- **Wind against current**: Northeast/east winds against northbound current create dangerous seas
- **Sea state**: Can go from 2-3 ft to 8-10 ft in minutes with wind shift
- **Escape routes**: Know closest inlet before heading offshore
- **Weather watch**: Monitor marine forecast for wind shifts

### Navigation in Current
- **Drift calculation**: 2-4 knot northbound set affects all navigation
- **Fuel planning**: Factor current into fuel consumption calculations  
- **Anchoring**: Use heavy tackle, scope for strong current
- **Drift fishing**: Plan for boat movement when fishing

### Emergency Procedures
- **May Day protocol**: VHF 16, GPS coordinates, nature of emergency
- **Coast Guard**: Station Fort Lauderdale responds to SE Florida waters
- **Sea Tow/Boat US**: Know membership status and local tower locations
- **Float plan**: Always file with reliable person ashore

## Shipping Lanes & Commercial Traffic

### Port Everglades Traffic
- **Inbound/outbound lanes**: Marked shipping channels
- **Cruise ship schedule**: Heavy traffic Sat/Sun and holidays
- **Cargo vessels**: Container ships and tankers have limited maneuverability
- **Stay clear**: Give commercial vessels wide berth

### Offshore Traffic
- **International shipping** — Major north/south shipping route 10-20 miles offshore
- **AIS monitoring** — Use AIS to track large vessel movements
- **Right of way** — Commercial vessels have right of way in shipping lanes

## Weather Hazards

### Thunderstorms (May-October)
- **Timing**: Peak activity 2-6 PM daily
- **Lightning**: Most dangerous aspect — get off water when storms approach
- **30/30 rule**: Seek shelter when thunder within 30 seconds, wait 30 minutes after last thunder
- **Radar interpretation**: Use weather radar apps to track storm movement

### Hurricane Season (June-November)
- **Preparation**: Have hurricane plan for boat storage/evacuation
- **Storm surge**: ICW and river areas vulnerable to surge
- **Marinas**: Know marina hurricane policies and lift schedules
- **Evacuation routes**: Plan early, don't wait for mandatory evacuation

### Cold Fronts (October-April)  
- **Wind shifts**: Rapid wind shifts from southeast to northwest
- **Temperature drops**: 20-30 degree temperature drops in hours
- **Sea state**: Confused seas during wind shift
- **Hypothermia risk**: Water temperature vs air temperature dangerous in winter

## Equipment & Regulations

### Required Safety Equipment
- **Life jackets**: USCG approved, properly sized, one per person
- **Flares**: Current unexpired flares, day/night signals
- **Sound signals**: Horn or whistle, bell for boats >39 ft
- **Fire extinguisher**: Proper size/type for vessel, current inspection
- **Throwable device**: Type IV PFD required for boats >16 ft

### Communication Equipment
- **VHF radio**: Primary emergency communication, monitor channel 16
- **EPIRB/PLB**: For offshore fishing beyond VHF range
- **Cell phone**: In waterproof case, backup communication
- **Satellite communicator**: For extended offshore or Bahamas trips

### Navigation Equipment
- **GPS/chartplotter**: Primary navigation, backup paper charts
- **Compass**: Magnetic compass for GPS backup
- **Depth sounder**: Critical for inlet and ICW navigation
- **Radar**: Helpful for weather and navigation in low visibility
