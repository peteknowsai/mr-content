# Weather — Southeast Florida

Write marine weather and conditions cards for SE Florida captains.

## NOAA Zones
- **AMZ173** — Coastal waters from Deerfield Beach to Ocean Reef
- **AMZ175** — Offshore waters from Deerfield Beach to Ocean Reef out to 20nm
- **AMZ177** — Offshore waters from Deerfield Beach to Ocean Reef 20-60nm
- **AMZ174** — Coastal waters from Jupiter Inlet to Deerfield Beach
- **AMZ176** — Offshore waters from Jupiter Inlet to Deerfield Beach out to 20nm

## Data Sources
- `api.weather.gov` — marine forecasts (free, no key)
- `tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov` — tide predictions, water temp
- NDBC buoys: Station 41009 (28nm ESE of Cape Canaveral), Station FWYF1 (Fowey Rocks)
- Gulf Stream position and temperature data

## What SE Florida Captains Care About

### Wind & Seas
- **Northeast winds** — dangerous for inlet navigation, especially Jupiter and Hillsboro
- **Southeast trade winds** — summer pattern, generally fishable
- **Gulf Stream wind-against-current** — can build dangerous seas quickly
- **Afternoon thunderstorms** — May-Oct pattern, most activity 2-6pm

### Tides & Currents
- **Inlet tides** — critical for safe navigation, especially Hillsboro and Jupiter
- **Gulf Stream current** — 2-4 knots northbound, affects drift fishing
- **ICW tides** — shallow areas from Palm Beach Gardens north

### Water Temperature
- **Below 72°F** — sailfish start showing up (Dec-Jan)
- **Above 78°F** — mahi move in close, best offshore fishing (May-Aug)
- **Gulf Stream temp differential** — blue water 5-10°F warmer than inshore

## Seasonal Patterns

### Winter (Dec-Mar)
- **Cold fronts** — 3-5 day cycles, north winds behind fronts
- **Trade winds** — southeast 10-15 knots between fronts  
- **Best fishing weather** — calmer seas, cooler water brings sailfish

### Summer (May-Sep)
- **Trade winds** — consistent southeast 10-15 knots
- **Afternoon storms** — daily pattern, morning fishing windows
- **Hurricane season** — June-November, peak Aug-Oct

### Transition (Apr, Oct-Nov)
- **Variable conditions** — weather patterns shifting
- **Best offshore fishing** — stable conditions, active fish

## Card Types
- **Marine forecast briefing** — today/tomorrow conditions, go/no-go for offshore
- **Inlet navigation alert** — when conditions make inlets dangerous
- **Gulf Stream forecast** — offshore conditions and fishing implications
- **Hurricane prep** — tropical weather prep for SE Florida boaters
- **Seasonal weather guide** — what to expect this month

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Protected marinas for storm season storage
- Fuel docks open early to beat afternoon storms
- Full-service boatyards for hurricane prep (especially Fort Lauderdale)

## Style
- Lead with the actionable take: "Good offshore day" or "Inlets bumpy today"
- Always mention Gulf Stream conditions for offshore fishing
- Specific inlet conditions when wind/tide combinations are dangerous
- Reference afternoon storm timing in summer months
