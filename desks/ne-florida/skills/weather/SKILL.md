# Weather — NE Florida

Write marine weather and conditions cards for First Coast captains.

## NOAA Zones
- **AMZ152** — St. Johns River
- **AMZ132** — Coastal waters from Fernandina Beach to St. Augustine
- **AMZ152** — Nassau Sound to St. Johns River entrance
- **GMZ830** — Atlantic waters 20-60nm east of Jacksonville

## Data Sources
- `api.weather.gov` — marine forecasts (free, no key)
- `tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov` — tide predictions, water temp
- NDBC buoys: Station FWYF1 (Fernandina Beach), Station 41112 (offshore)
- Naval Station Mayport weather (military operations impact)

## What First Coast Captains Care About

### River Conditions
- **Tidal current** — St. Johns flows north but tide dominates. Spring tides = strong current
- **Water levels** — heavy rain upriver affects salinity and fish behavior
- **Fog** — common in winter months, especially early morning river trips
- **Bridge restrictions** — high tide + tall boat = check clearances

### Coastal/Offshore
- **Northeast winds** — make bar conditions at Mayport inlet dangerous
- **Sea breeze** — builds afternoon chop, especially summer
- **Gulf Stream position** — affects offshore fishing conditions (40+ miles out)
- **Tropical season** — Jun-Nov, different track patterns than South Florida

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Winter** (Dec-Feb) — nor'easters, fog, best river fishing weather
- **Spring** (Mar-May) — variable winds, cobia weather, pleasant conditions
- **Summer** (Jun-Aug) — afternoon thunderstorms, southeast sea breeze pattern
- **Fall** (Sep-Nov) — tropical season tail end, excellent fishing weather

## Unique NE Florida Weather

### Nor'easters
- **Common winter pattern** — strong NE winds, rough seas, great river alternative
- **Duration** — typically 2-3 days, different from tropical systems
- **Silver lining** — pushes bait up river, excellent fishing after passage

### River vs Ocean Decision Matrix
- **NE winds 15+ kt** — ocean stays rough longer, fish the river
- **SW winds 15+ kt** — river gets choppy, better offshore
- **Thunderstorms** — river offers more shelter options than open ocean
- **Fog** — river more dangerous due to traffic, offshore clearer

### Military Impact
- **Training exercises** — check NOTAMs for offshore restrictions
- **Base weather** — Mayport reports available, impacts local boating

## Card Types
- **Marine forecast briefing** — river vs ocean conditions, where to fish today
- **Storm prep** — hurricane vs nor'easter preparation differences  
- **Seasonal weather guide** — what to expect this month on First Coast
- **River conditions** — tidal current, water levels, visibility
- **Offshore conditions** — sea state, Gulf Stream, weather windows

## Port32 Tie-ins
- River location = shelter option when offshore is blown out
- Valet service = check conditions morning-of, boat ready quickly
- Fuel dock = top off when weather window opens
- Indoor storage = protection from nor'easters and tropical systems

## Style
- Lead with the river vs ocean choice: "River day" or "Offshore window"
- Specific wind speeds/directions, not vague terms
- Always mention tide stage for river fishing
- Reference military operations when relevant to boating access
- Acknowledge this isn't South Florida — different patterns, different solutions
