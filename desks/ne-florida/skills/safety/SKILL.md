# Safety — NE Florida

Write safety and navigation cards specific to First Coast waters.

## St. Johns River Safety

### Navigation Hazards
- **Commercial traffic** — large ships use deep channel, monitor VHF 16
- **Tidal current** — flows north but tide dominates, spring tides especially strong
- **Shallow areas** — stay in marked channels, especially at low tide
- **Bridge clearances** — check height at current tide level before transit
- **Fog conditions** — common winter mornings, poor visibility, use radar/GPS

### Current and Tide
- **Spring tides** — new/full moon, strongest currents, plan timing
- **Tidal range** — 6-8 feet typical, affects clearances and access
- **Current direction** — opposite of wind creates steep chop
- **Dead low tide** — many areas inaccessible, check charts carefully
- **High tide flooding** — extreme high tides can affect riverside facilities

### River-Specific Regulations
- **Manatee zones** — winter slow zones, heavy fines for violations
- **No motor zones** — several areas, especially near springs and parks
- **Commercial right-of-way** — large vessels have limited maneuverability
- **Anchorage areas** — designated spots only, not allowed everywhere
- **Speed zones** — posted limits strictly enforced

## Mayport Inlet & Jetties

### Bar Conditions
- **Northeast winds** — create dangerous bar conditions, check before crossing
- **Tidal timing** — fish during strong tide = rough inlet conditions
- **Swell interaction** — ocean swell + tidal current = confused seas
- **Size recommendations** — 20ft+ boats recommended for rough conditions
- **Local knowledge** — watch other boats, ask charter captains

### Military Considerations
- **Naval Station Mayport** — restricted areas clearly marked, strictly enforced
- **Security zones** — temporary restrictions during high alert
- **Submarine operations** — submerged vessels, maintain distance
- **Training exercises** — check NOTAMs for temporary restrictions
- **Emergency contact** — VHF 16 for Coast Guard, Channel 12 for base operations

## Offshore Atlantic Safety

### Weather Awareness
- **Gulf Stream position** — 40+ miles out, different weather patterns
- **Waterspout season** — summer months, sudden formation
- **Fog conditions** — winter and spring, can develop quickly
- **Lightning** — afternoon thunderstorms, get off water immediately
- **Storm approach** — nor'easters move fast, different from tropical systems

### Distance Considerations
- **20+ mile runs common** — fuel planning critical
- **Cell coverage** — spotty beyond 20 miles, carry satellite communication
- **Nearest inlet** — Mayport primary, St. Augustine backup 30+ miles south
- **Current awareness** — Gulf Stream starts 40 miles out, plan fuel accordingly

### Emergency Preparedness
- **VHF radio required** — Coast Guard monitors 16, working 22A
- **Flares/signals** — required equipment, check expiration dates
- **Life jackets** — one per person plus throwable, properly fitted
- **EPIRB/PLB** — recommended for offshore, automatic distress beacon
- **Float plan** — leave with reliable person, include return time

## Special First Coast Hazards

### Military Operations
- **Restricted areas** — clearly marked but strictly enforced
- **Training schedules** — can affect large offshore areas
- **Emergency protocols** — know how to contact appropriate authorities
- **Respectful distance** — Navy vessels have right-of-way, maintain distance

### Environmental
- **Manatee interactions** — year-round but peak winter, slow down/report injuries
- **Shark safety** — bull sharks common in river, especially summer
- **Jellyfish seasons** — sea nettle blooms, painful but not dangerous
- **Red tide potential** — less common than west coast but can occur

### Navigation Technology
- **GPS backup** — river has many unmarked hazards
- **Chart updates** — shoaling common, keep charts current
- **Depth sounder** — essential for river navigation
- **VHF weather** — NOAA weather radio for marine forecasts

## Card Types
- **River navigation guide** — safe transit tips for St. Johns River
- **Inlet conditions** — how to read Mayport bar, when not to go
- **Military area awareness** — how to respect restricted zones
- **Emergency procedures** — what to do when things go wrong
- **Seasonal safety** — winter fog, summer storms, year-round hazards

## Port32 Safety Benefits
- **Protected location** — river location = safer than inlet-mouth marinas
- **Professional staff** — local knowledge of conditions and hazards
- **Weather monitoring** — staff tracks conditions, advises members
- **Emergency response** — established procedures for member assistance
- **Training opportunities** — safety courses, local knowledge seminars

## Local Emergency Contacts
- **Coast Guard Mayport** — VHF 16, (904) 714-7558
- **Marine Patrol** — Florida FWC, report violations
- **TowBoat US** — commercial towing, (904) XXX-XXXX
- **Sea Tow** — alternative towing service
- **Mayport Base Security** — report suspicious activity near military areas
