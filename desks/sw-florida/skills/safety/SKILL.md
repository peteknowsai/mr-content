# Safety — SW Florida

Write safety and navigation cards for SW Florida captains covering local hazards, regulations, and best practices.

## Pass & Inlet Conditions

### Gordon Pass (Naples)
- **Depth**: Varies 6-12 feet, shifts with storms
- **Hazards**: Very shallow, rough in west/northwest winds
- **Best conditions**: Light east winds, rising tide
- **Caution**: Can close completely after major storms
- **Local knowledge**: Favor the north side, watch for breaking waves

### Caxambas Pass (Marco Island)  
- **Depth**: Generally 8-15 feet
- **Hazards**: Shoaling on south side, strong currents
- **Conditions**: Better protected than Gordon Pass
- **Caution**: Current can be very strong on large tide changes
- **Navigation**: Stay in marked channel, updated surveys important

### Captiva Pass (Sanibel area)
- **Depth**: Variable, 6-12 feet typical
- **Hazards**: Shallow bars extend well offshore
- **Conditions**: Local knowledge essential
- **Caution**: Breaking seas common in southwest winds
- **Alternative**: Redfish Pass to the north may be better option

### Boca Grande Pass
- **Depth**: Deep water pass, 25+ feet
- **Hazards**: Extremely strong currents, wind-against-tide very rough
- **Caution**: Can be dangerous in small boats when wind opposes tide
- **Timing**: Best on slack tide or favorable wind/tide combination

## Shallow Water Navigation

### 10,000 Islands
- **Extreme shallow**: Areas with less than 2 feet at low tide
- **Tidal range**: 3+ foot tidal range affects many areas
- **Hazards**: Oyster bars, shoals, narrow channels
- **Required**: Shallow draft boat, local knowledge, GPS chartplotter
- **Safety**: Always carry push pole, emergency flares

### Charlotte Harbor
- **Vast shallows**: Extensive flats less than 4 feet deep
- **Wind effects**: Strong winds can blow water out, stranding boats
- **Navigation**: Stay in marked channels, use GPS constantly
- **Tide timing**: Plan trips around tide levels
- **Emergency**: Know deepwater escape routes

### Pine Island Sound
- **Draft limitations**: Much of area less than 3 feet
- **Maze navigation**: Complex system of channels and flats
- **Hazards**: Can easily run aground in unfamiliar areas
- **Local charts**: Essential for safe navigation
- **Speed**: Go slow, look for color changes in water

## Weather Safety

### Thunderstorms
- **Peak danger**: May through October, especially afternoon
- **Lightning risk**: SW Florida has highest strike rates in US
- **30/30 rule**: Seek shelter if thunder within 30 seconds, wait 30 minutes after last thunder
- **Morning strategy**: Early trips to avoid afternoon buildups
- **Warning signs**: Cumulus clouds building, darkening skies, increasing winds

### Hurricane Season (June 1 - November 30)
- **Peak months**: August through October  
- **Storm surge risk**: SW Florida very vulnerable due to shallow continental shelf
- **Preparation**: Boats must be secured or moved inland well in advance
- **Post-storm**: Expect navigation aid displacement, debris, changed channels

### Cold Fronts (Winter)
- **Rapid changes**: Temperature can drop 30+ degrees in hours
- **Wind shifts**: Southwest to northwest winds, can be very strong
- **Hypothermia risk**: Water temperature vs air temperature creates danger
- **Preparation**: Monitor weather, have warm clothing aboard

## Biological Hazards

### Manatees
- **Speed zones**: Numerous throughout SW Florida waters
- **Peak activity**: Warmer months, around warm water discharges
- **Regulations**: Heavy fines for harassment or injury
- **Behavior**: Go extremely slow in posted areas, watch for swirls
- **Areas**: Naples area canals, Caloosahatchee River, warm water outfalls

### Red Tide (Karenia brevis)
- **Health effects**: Respiratory irritation, skin/eye irritation  
- **Fish kills**: Dead fish indicate bloom presence
- **Monitoring**: Check FWC red tide status before trips
- **Avoidance**: Don't eat fish from affected areas
- **Peak risk**: Late summer through winter

### Stingrays
- **Shallow water**: Common on grass flats throughout region
- **Prevention**: Shuffle feet when wading, wear shoes
- **Treatment**: Hot water (not scalding) helps with pain
- **Season**: More active in warmer months

## Navigation Hazards

### Unmarked Shoals
- **10,000 Islands**: Numerous unmarked shallow areas
- **Charlotte Harbor**: Constantly shifting sandbars
- **Naples area**: Sandbars near passes
- **Prevention**: Use updated charts, GPS, watch water color
- **Grounding**: Don't power off, wait for rising tide if possible

### Bridge Clearances
- **Sanibel Causeway**: 70 feet  
- **Cape Coral bridges**: Various heights, check charts
- **Bascule bridges**: Some open on schedule, others on demand
- **Tide effects**: High tide reduces clearance
- **Planning**: Know your boat's air draft including antennas

### Commercial Traffic
- **Naples area**: Large yachts transiting to/from Caribbean
- **Caloosahatchee River**: Moderate commercial traffic
- **ICW**: Heavy traffic Ft Myers to Marco Island
- **Rules**: Stay clear, monitor VHF Channel 16
- **Passes**: Commercial vessels have right-of-way in narrow channels

## Emergency Preparedness

### Required Safety Equipment
- **Life jackets**: One per person, children must wear
- **Flares**: Unexpired visual distress signals  
- **Sound devices**: Horn or whistle for fog/emergency
- **Fire extinguisher**: Properly mounted and inspected
- **VHF radio**: Monitor Channel 16, weather channels

### Recommended Additional Equipment
- **Cell phone**: In waterproof case
- **GPS**: With local charts loaded
- **First aid kit**: Include seasickness medication
- **Tool kit**: Basic tools and spare parts
- **Anchor**: Proper size for boat and area
- **Food/water**: More than planned trip duration

### Emergency Contacts
- **Coast Guard**: VHF Channel 16, or *CG (*24)
