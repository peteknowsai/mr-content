## What SW Florida Captains Care About

### Wind Patterns
- **East winds** — great for Gulf runs, calm on inshore flats
- **West/Southwest** — can make passes rough, especially Gordon Pass and Caxambas
- **North winds** — push water out of shallow areas, can make flats unfishable
- **Anything over 20kt** — small boats should stay protected

### Thunderstorms
- **Peak season**: May–October, especially July-September  
- **Daily pattern**: Sea breeze convergence creates afternoon storms
- **Lightning danger**: SW Florida has among highest strike rates in US
- **Morning fishing**: Best window before storms build

### Tides & Water Levels
- **Low tide navigation**: Many SW Florida areas very shallow - Pine Island Sound, 10,000 Islands
- **Spring tides**: Extreme lows can strand boats, extreme highs flood docks
- **Wind-driven tides**: Strong winds can affect water levels more than predicted tides

### Seasonal Patterns
- **Winter (Dec-Mar)**: Cold fronts bring north winds, clear skies. Best weather window
- **Spring (Apr-May)**: Variable winds, occasional fronts, generally great conditions  
- **Summer (Jun-Aug)**: Daily storms, hot, humid, southeast trade wind pattern
- **Fall (Sep-Nov)**: Hurricane season peak, but often great fishing weather

### Red Tide
- **Karenia brevis blooms** — monitor Florida Fish and Wildlife red tide reports
- **Respiratory effects** — can cause coughing, throat irritation
- **Dead fish** — major blooms cause fish kills, beach closures
- **Southwest Florida susceptible** — Gulf currents can concentrate blooms here

## Special Considerations

### Passes & Inlets
- **Gordon Pass** (Naples) — shallow, can be very rough in west winds
- **Caxambas Pass** (Marco) — better protected, but watch for shoaling
- **Captiva Pass** — can be challenging, local knowledge required
- **Boca Grande Pass** — deep water but strong currents, wind-against-tide rough

### Shallow Water Areas  
- **10,000 Islands** — extremely shallow, tide-dependent navigation
- **Pine Island Sound** — vast shallow area, draft limitations
- **Charlotte Harbor flats** — extensive shallow areas, wind affects water levels

### Hurricane Season
- **Peak months**: August–October
- **Storm surge risk**: Southwest Florida very vulnerable due to shallow continental shelf
- **Prep time**: Boats need to be secured or moved inland well before arrival
- **Post-storm**: Navigation aids may be moved, debris common

## Card Types
- **Marine forecast briefing** — conditions for next 24-48 hours, go/no-go assessment
- **Weekend outlook** — longer range planning for trips
- **Storm prep** — tropical weather awareness, hurricane preparation
- **Seasonal guide** — what to expect this month in SW Florida waters
- **Pass conditions** — specific guidance for inlet conditions based on wind/tide
- **Lightning safety** — when to get off the water (30/30 rule)

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Protected marina storage keeps boats safe during severe weather
- Fuel docks allow topping off before weather windows
- Weather monitoring helps optimize launch scheduling
- Covered storage protects from UV during intense summer sun

## Style
- Lead with actionable guidance: "Great day for the backcountry" or "Rough on the passes today"
- Specific wind speeds, directions, and timing
- Include tide timing when relevant for shallow areas
- Always mention thunderstorm timing during summer months
- Reference local knowledge (Gordon Pass rough in west wind, etc.)
