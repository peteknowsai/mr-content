# Weather — Crystal Coast

Write marine weather and conditions cards for Crystal Coast captains.

## NOAA Zones
- **AMZ254** — Pamlico and Core Sounds
- **AMZ250** — Cape Hatteras to Cape Lookout nearshore waters
- **AMZ230** — Cape Hatteras to Cape Lookout offshore waters (20-60nm)

## Data Sources
- `api.weather.gov` — marine forecasts (free, no key)
- `tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov` — tide predictions for Beaufort Inlet
- NDBC buoys: Station 41025 (Diamond Shoals), Station 41013 (Frying Pan Shoals)

## What Crystal Coast Captains Care About
- **Wind vs Tide in Beaufort Inlet** — opposing forces create dangerous conditions
- **Nor'easters** — major winter weather pattern. Can bring gales and rough seas
- **Cold Fronts** — dramatic temperature drops in fall/winter/spring
- **Water Temperature** — drives fish behavior. Winter=bluefin, Spring=drum runs
- **Gulf Stream Conditions** — offshore weather/swell for blue water fishing
- **Hurricane Season** — June-November, but NC gets more late-season storms

## Seasonal Weather Patterns

### Spring (Mar-May)
- Cold fronts still common — dramatic temperature swings
- Nor'easters possible through April
- Increasing south winds as high pressure moves offshore
- Water temps rising — triggers fish movement

### Summer (Jun-Aug)  
- Most stable weather period
- Afternoon thunderstorms from heating
- Hurricane season begins — track tropics
- Best Gulf Stream weather windows

### Fall (Sep-Nov)
- Cold fronts return — often strong
- Nor'easters begin again  
- Hurricane peak season (September)
- Rapid cooling — layer up for October trips

### Winter (Dec-Feb)
- Nor'easters dominant weather pattern
- Strong cold fronts with gale-force winds
- Ice possible in sounds during extreme cold
- Bluefin season — but weather-dependent

## Beaufort Inlet Considerations
- **Wind Against Tide** = dangerous conditions even in moderate winds
- **Outgoing Tide + North Wind** = particularly nasty
- **Shoaling** — inlet changes, check for current conditions
- **Local Weather Knowledge** — conditions can be very different inside vs outside

## Card Types
- **Inlet conditions briefing** — safe passage assessment for Beaufort Inlet
- **Nor'easter prep** — winter storm preparation for coastal boaters
- **Four-season weather guide** — what to expect this month in NC
- **Cold front safety** — rapid weather changes and preparation
- **Gulf Stream weather window** — offshore fishing conditions

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Downtown Morehead City location provides weather protection
- Quick access to inlet — check conditions before departing
- Fuel dock for topping off before weather windows close
- Safe harbor during nor'easters and cold fronts

## Style
- Always lead with inlet conditions — most critical safety factor
- Include water temperature when relevant to fishing
- Mention layering/gear needs — this isn't Florida
- Be specific about wind direction relative to tide for inlet safety
