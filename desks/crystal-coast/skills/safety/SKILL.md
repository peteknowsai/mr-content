# Safety — Crystal Coast

Write marine safety cards for Crystal Coast captains navigating NC waters.

## Beaufort Inlet — Critical Safety Information

### Inlet Conditions
- **Wind vs Tide** — Most dangerous condition. Opposing forces create steep, breaking seas
- **Outgoing Tide + North Wind** — Particularly hazardous combination
- **Shoaling Changes** — Inlet migrates, channels shift, use current charts
- **Local Knowledge** — Conditions inside sound can be completely different from outside

### Navigation Hazards
- **Shackleford Banks** — Extensive shallow areas south of inlet
- **Cape Lookout Shoals** — Shoal areas extending seaward from point
- **Seasonal Changes** — Storm-driven shoaling, especially after hurricanes
- **Commercial Traffic** — Large charter boats and commercial vessels

## Weather Safety

### Nor'easters
- **Strongest Winds** — Often 35-50+ knots, can last 2-3 days
- **Direction Change** — Winds shift from northeast to northwest as storms pass
- **Storm Surge** — Can affect inlet depths and current flow
- **Preparation** — Monitor 5-day forecasts, nor'easters track slowly

### Cold Fronts
- **Rapid Change** — Temperature drops 30-40°F possible in hours
- **Strong Winds** — Often precede fronts, then shift direction quickly
- **Hypothermia Risk** — Cold water (40-60°F winter) = survival time measured in minutes
- **Layered Clothing** — Essential for fall/winter/spring boating

### Hurricane Season
- **Peak Period** — August through October for NC
- **Late Season Storms** — NC often hit by storms that missed further south
- **Storm Surge** — Low-lying areas flood, marina damage possible
- **Preparation** — Have hurricane plan, track systems early

## Cold Water Safety
- **Water Temperature** — Can be 40-50°F in winter, 60-70°F spring/fall
- **Survival Time** — 30 minutes or less in 40°F water without protection
- **Hypothermia** — Occurs rapidly, affects judgment and motor skills
- **Personal Flotation** — PFDs essential, consider immersion suits for winter offshore

## Offshore Safety (Gulf Stream)

### Distance Considerations
- **30+ Miles** — Long run to Gulf Stream fishing grounds
- **Weather Windows** — Check 48-hour marine forecast minimum
- **Fuel Planning** — Calculate round trip plus 30% reserve
- **Communication** — VHF radio coverage limited, consider satellite communication

### Equipment Requirements
- **EPIRB** — Essential for Gulf Stream fishing
- **Life Raft** — Consider for serious offshore fishing
- **Flares** — Current dated signaling devices
- **First Aid** — Advanced kit for distance from shore

## Four-Season Considerations

### Winter Boating
- **Ice Formation** — Possible in sounds during extreme cold snaps
- **Shorter Days** — Plan trips around daylight hours
- **Emergency Gear** — Extra clothing, emergency shelter
- **Engine Prep** — Antifreeze, battery maintenance in cold

### Spring/Fall
- **Rapidly Changing Weather** — Front frequency increases
- **Clothing Strategy** — Layer system for temperature swings
- **Dawn/Dusk** — Cool temperatures even on warm days

## Emergency Resources
- **US Coast Guard Station Fort Macon** — Primary SAR resource
- **TowBoatUS** — Commercial towing service coverage
- **VHF Channel 16** — Emergency hailing frequency
- **Marine Weather Radio** — NOAA Weather Radio essential

## Local Safety Culture
- **Buddy Boat System** — Travel with other boats for offshore trips
- **Float Plan** — Leave detailed plans with reliable person shore-side
- **Local Knowledge** — Tap into Morehead City's deep fishing/boating experience
- **Charter Captains** — Consider guided trips for first-time Gulf Stream runs

## Card Types
- **Beaufort Inlet conditions** — Current inlet safety assessment
- **Nor'easter prep** — Severe weather preparation checklist
- **Cold water safety** — Hypothermia prevention and survival
- **Offshore safety brief** — Gulf Stream trip preparation
- **Four-season boating** — Seasonal safety considerations
