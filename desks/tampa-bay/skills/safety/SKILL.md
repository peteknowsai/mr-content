# Safety — Tampa Bay

Write local safety and navigation cards for Tampa Bay captains.

## Tampa Bay-Specific Hazards
- **Bunces Pass bar** — shifts seasonally. Can be as shallow as 2' at low tide. Favor mid-high tide
- **Manatee zones** — idle/slow speed zones throughout the bay, especially near passes and marinas. Year-round but enforced heavily Nov–Mar
- **Afternoon thunderstorms** — May through October. Lightning capital of the US. Be off the water by 2-3 PM or watch radar closely
- **Shipping channel** — deep-draft vessels have right of way. Stay clear of the main channel near Port Tampa/MacDill
- **Bridge spans** — know your clearance. Skyway (175' center span), Gandy (44'), Howard Frankland (44'), Courtney Campbell (29')
- **Crab trap floats** — everywhere Oct–May. Watch for lines near your prop

## Navigation Tips
- Follow markers in passes — cutting corners = running aground
- Tampa Bay is shallow. Average depth ~12'. Flats can be 1-3' at low tide
- Johns Pass (north of Tierra Verde) is tight and has strong current
- GPS charts are approximate — visual navigation matters in shallow water

## Card Types
- **Navigation hazard alert** — specific hazard, where, when it's worst
- **Storm safety** — lightning protocol, what to do if caught out
- **Seasonal safety** — manatee season reminders, crab trap season
- **First-timer navigation** — how to read the bay if you're new
