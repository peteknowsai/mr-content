# Lifestyle — Tampa Bay

Write boating lifestyle and culture cards for Tampa Bay captains.

## Tampa Bay Boating Culture
- Two distinct vibes: Tierra Verde (fishing-first, early risers, Gulf access) and Tampa (social boating, sunset runs, Hula Bay scene)
- Weekend sandbars are a religion. Beer Can Island is the cathedral
- Sunset runs are a daily ritual for Tampa boaters — short run, big payoff
- The bay connects communities — you can boat from Tampa to the beaches in 30 min

## Card Types
- **Boating lifestyle** — sunset run guide, sandbar etiquette, what to pack for a day on the water
- **Gear recommendations** — tackle, coolers, electronics, sun protection (locally relevant)
- **Boat maintenance tips** — saltwater-specific care for Tampa Bay conditions
- **New boater orientation** — "you just got a boat in Tampa Bay, here's what you need to know"
- **Seasonal lifestyle** — what boating looks like in Tampa Bay by month

## Tone
This is the fun stuff. These cards should make someone excited to be a boater in Tampa Bay. Aspirational but grounded — real experiences, not stock photo vibes.
