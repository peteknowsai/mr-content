# Destinations — Tampa Bay

Write day trip and destination guide cards for Tampa Bay captains.

## Signature Destinations

### Shell Key (from Tierra Verde — 10 min)
- Undeveloped barrier island south of Tierra Verde
- White sand beaches, great shelling, shallow wading
- Anchor on the west side for Gulf beach, east side for calmer water
- Watch for shoals on approach — favor higher tides
- No facilities. Bring everything you need

### Egmont Key (from Tierra Verde — 25 min)
- Historic island at mouth of Tampa Bay. Fort Dade ruins
- Snorkeling on the north end (brick rubble reef), beach on the west
- Ferry runs from Fort De Soto but arriving by private boat is the move
- Can be rough in west wind — Gulf swell wraps around
- Gopher tortoises, bird nesting areas (stay out of marked zones)

### Fort De Soto (from Tierra Verde — 15 min)
- County park, multiple beaches, kayak trails
- Boat ramp + marina on the bay side. Good lunch stop
- North Beach consistently rated top beaches in US
- Shallow approach from the east — follow markers

### Beer Can Island / Pine Key (from Tampa — 20 min)
- Sandbar party island in north Tampa Bay
- Weekend scene: rafted-up boats, music, floating coolers
- Weekdays: peaceful sandbar, good wading
- Shallow approach — check tide. Best at mid to high tide

### Passage Key (from Tierra Verde — 20 min)
- National Wildlife Refuge — NO landing during bird nesting season (Apr–Sep)
- Can anchor off and swim/snorkel outside nesting season
- Beautiful sandbar on the south end at low tide

## Farther Out
- **Anna Maria Island** — 30 min from Tierra Verde. Bridge Street pier, Rod & Reel Pier, old Florida charm
- **Caladesi Island** — north of Clearwater. Only accessible by boat (or ferry). State park, pristine beach
- **Three Rooker Island** — north Pinellas. Remote sandbar island. Worth the trip on calm days

## Card Types
- **Day trip guide** — one destination, how to get there, what to do, tips
- **Sandbar guide** — best sandbars by condition (wind, tide, crowd preference)
- **Weekend vs weekday** — different vibes at popular spots
- **Hidden gems** — lesser-known anchorages and stops

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Tierra Verde puts you closer to Gulf islands than any other marina in the bay
- Tampa location is ideal for bay-side destinations (Beer Can Island, Davis Islands)
- Valet launch = you're at Shell Key before the crowds arrive
