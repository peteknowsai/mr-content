# Dining — Tampa Bay

Write dock-and-dine and waterfront restaurant cards for Tampa Bay captains.

## Dock-and-Dine from Tierra Verde
- **Island Grille & Raw Bar** — walking distance from Port32 Tierra Verde. Casual seafood, great grouper sandwich
- **Billy's Stone Crab** — Tierra Verde. Stone crab in season (Oct 15–May 15). Dock space limited
- **The Getaway** — St Pete Beach area. Tiki bar, casual. Can anchor/dock nearby
- **Doc Ford's Rum Bar** — St Pete Pier. Good dock space. Island-inspired seafood
- **Caddy's on the Beach** — Treasure Island. Beach bar. Raft up or anchor off the beach

## Dock-and-Dine from Tampa
- **Hula Bay Club** — ON-SITE at Port32 Tampa. Polynesian-inspired, waterfront. The default post-boating spot
- **Rick's on the River** — Hillsborough River. Biker bar meets waterfront. Legendary burgers
- **Ulele** — Tampa Riverwalk. Upscale Florida-Native inspired. Dock on the river
- **Salt Shack on the Bay** — Bay-to-Bay area. Casual waterfront, live music weekends
- **Bahama Breeze** — Rocky Point. Chain but good waterfront location

## By Boat (Worth the Run)
- **Hurricane Seafood** — Pass-A-Grille. Institution. Rooftop deck. No dock but anchor off the beach
- **Frenchy's** — Clearwater Beach. Touristy but the grouper is legit
- **Palm Pavilion** — Clearwater Beach. Better food, less tourist chaos than Frenchy's

## Card Types
- **Restaurant spotlight** — one restaurant, how to get there by boat, what to order, dock info
- **Dock-and-dine roundup** — best options from a specific marina
- **Date night by boat** — upscale waterfront options
- **After-fishing grub** — casual spots near the ramp/marina

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Hula Bay Club is literally at Port32 Tampa — that's your post-run default
- Tierra Verde location = quick run to Pass-A-Grille, St Pete Beach restaurants
- Valet service means you come back, dock, and walk to dinner. Boat gets flushed and stored
