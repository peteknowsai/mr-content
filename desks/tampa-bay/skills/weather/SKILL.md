# Weather — Tampa Bay

Write marine weather and conditions cards for Tampa Bay captains.

## NOAA Zones
- **AMZ154** — Tampa Bay waters
- **AMZ131** — Coastal waters Tarpon Springs to Englewood
- **GMZ830** — Gulf waters 20-60nm west of Tampa Bay

## Data Sources
- `api.weather.gov` — marine forecasts (free, no key)
- `tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov` — tide predictions, water temp
- NDBC buoys: Station 8726520 (St Petersburg), Station 8726384 (Port Manatee)

## What Tampa Bay Captains Care About
- **Wind** — anything over 15kt makes the bay choppy. 20kt+ and small boats should stay in
- **Lightning** — afternoon thunderstorms May–Oct. The Gulf coast is the lightning capital of the US
- **Tide** — critical for navigating passes (Bunces, Johns). Low tide exposes bars
- **Water temp** — drives fish behavior. Below 65°F = tough bite. Above 80°F = tarpon time
- **Gulf swell** — even 3-4ft Gulf swell makes passes uncomfortable in a center console

## Card Types
- **Marine forecast briefing** — today/tomorrow conditions, go/no-go assessment
- **Storm prep** — tropical weather awareness, hurricane prep for boaters
- **Seasonal weather guide** — what to expect this month on Tampa Bay
- **Lightning safety** — when to get off the water (the "30/30 rule")

## Port32 Tie-ins
- Valet service means your boat is prepped and ready — check forecast morning-of
- Covered storage protects from hail and UV during storm season
- Fuel dock open early = beat the afternoon storms

## Style
- Lead with the actionable take: "Good day to be on the water" or "Stay in today"
- Specific wind speeds and directions, not vague "breezy"
- Always mention tide stage if relevant to navigation
